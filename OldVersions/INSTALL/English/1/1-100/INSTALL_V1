This project currently doesn't have to be installed to be viewed, as it is not completely functional yet. It requires that you have a version of C++ installed from version 2005 or later, which most operating systems have (such as Windows Vista no service pack/Windows XP Service Pack 3 and later, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and later, Linux Kernel 2.6.16 or later (derived systems) FreeBSD 4.10 or later, etc.)

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG, JPG, and GIF format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 2560x1440/2560x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG. PNG, and GIF files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md, *.mkd, *.mdown, *.markdown) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.

These installation instructions will need to be updated as the project progresses.
